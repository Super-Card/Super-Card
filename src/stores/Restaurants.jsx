Whether it is ice cream on the showcases all over the country or the dishes in our restaurants we always try not to disappoint you. Raffy for one year became an emblematic place in the center of Sofia, and only because he listens daily to the needs of his guests. The pleasant environment, the good food and service, the constant renovation of the interior and the menu and all at an affordable price quickly won the sympathy of Sofia residents. Now we are introducing our new Raffy food & music project. Meals are served until 22:30 in the evening, and from the morning you can have a cup of coffee on the panoramic terrace above Vitoshka. A great place for a party, and you already know our handwriting. Always the best for the best.',
